h2. Motivation

This project is part of a serie of CMake template designed to teach, simplify
and encourage the use of the CMake build system.

h2. Description

This module builds a small dummy C++ library. The library build system modular
design allows the library to be build standalone or within an application.

h2. Usage

h3. Build the library

In the project root directory, run the following commands to build the project:

bc. $ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

h3. Add the library to your project

To add this library to your application, first add

@set(simple-library_DIR /path/to/the/library)@

near the top of your application _CMakelists.txt_ file. You can then call

@find_package(simple-library REQUIRED)@

to configure the library. You can then add the line

@include_directories(${simple-library_include_dir})@

to add the library headers to your project include directories. After your
@add_executable()@ line, you can add

bc. add_dependencies(${PROJECT_NAME} simple-library)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} simple-library)
